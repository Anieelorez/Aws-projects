I've recently completed a hands-on experiment to showcase my proficiency in utilizing AWS services for hosting static websites. Here's a summary of the process:

1. **Static Website Creation:** I crafted a simple static website using HTML, laying out the structure and content as required.

2. **AWS S3 Bucket:** To host the website, I set up an Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) bucket on AWS. Within this bucket, I uploaded the primary HTML file, 'index.html,' along with any associated assets like images, stylesheets, or JavaScript files.

3. **Domain Registration with Route 53:** For a professional touch, I registered a custom domain name using Amazon Route 53, AWS's domain registration and DNS web service.

4. **Website Deployment:** I connected the dots by configuring Route 53 to route incoming web traffic to the S3 bucket where the website files were stored. This seamless integration ensured that my custom domain pointed directly to the static website hosted on the S3 bucket.

This experiment not only demonstrated my competence in working with AWS S3 and Route 53 but also illustrated my ability to set up and manage a basic web presence while ensuring proper DNS configuration for a custom domain.
